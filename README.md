# Vue Destinations CRUD App

This is a custom-built Vue 3 + Vite application for managing travel destinations.

The app supports dynamic routing with full CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete), client-side form validation, and 404 error handling.  
It was inspired by a YouTube tutorial but developed completely independently with custom structure, components, and logic.

## Scripts

Defined in `package.json`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview",
  "server": "json-server --watch src/data/destinations-server.json --port 8080"
},
```

## Usage

1. Launch the app with `npm run dev`
2. Click the "Login" button and use:
   - Username: `admin`
   - Password: `password`
3. On successful login, new options will appear (e.g., Add Destination)

## Notes

- Dynamic routes such as `/destinations/:slug` and `/destinations/edit/:slug` include logic to validate if the destination exists. If not, users are redirected to `/404`.
- Form validation includes required fields and positive number checks for price.
- Slugs are generated from the title and guaranteed to be unique via incremental suffixes if needed.

## Inspiration

This project is based on the same core idea as the jobs listing project from the [YouTube crash course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VeNfHj6MhgA). However, all code was written independently from scratch, following my own approach and implementation rather than copying existing code.
